  title: DataTiger Management API
  description: |
    

    ## Introduction 
    The Management API allows you to setup and configure a wide range of components:
    * Applications: Every domain (i.e. your company name), can have multiple applications. Each one has a unique name and is identified by a unique ID.  
    * Workflows: Every application can have multiple workflows. Often our workflows are also referred to as user journeys. Each one has a unique name and is identified by a unique ID.  
    * A/B Tests: we believe that you should be able to test pretty much everything you are doing, therefore A/B tests can be setup for all steps of a workflow. 
    

    ## General API concepts
    * Identifiers: All managed objects are uniquely identified by a platform generated identifier.
    This is returned when an object is created or whenever it is retrieved from the database.

    * Versioning: Several entities (such as the workflows) are immutable entities, as modifying them can lead to unpredicted behaviour (e.g. modifying a workflow while 
    it is executing). Updating such an entity results in a new version, with its own unique identifier. 

    ## Authentication
    Most requests need to be authenticated. Management API allows two types of authentication:
      - API Key (Bearer token)
      - Username/Password
      
    As Swagger 2.0 specification cannot properly describe these authentication schemes, please use this section as a reference on how the authentication works.    
    
    In the following sections that describe the requests, all requests that require authentication will have an optional 'Authorization' header. The API user can either 
    use this header for API token authentication or an authenticated HTTP session for username/password authentication.     
      
    ### API Key authentication
    The API key security model is mainly targeted for backends that use the DataTiger API. Each registered user account 
    of a client is assigned a unique api key which can be used to uniquely identify the user account. 
    When a client needs to access the DataTiger API they include the assigned API with each HTTP request to the API.

    The HTTP header 'Authorization' is used to specify that the requestor holds a valid access token. 
    Every request to the API must include an Authorization header with a value of the following form:
    
    ```
      Authorization: Bearer <TokenString>
    ```
    The value after 'Bearer' is the actual API key. Note: The header name is *not* case sensitive.
    
    For instance, getting the list of all available applications using curl:
    ```
    curl -X GET \
    https://preprod.api.datatiger.com/applications \
    -H 'authorization: Bearer token_placeholder' 
    ```
    
    ### Username/Password authentication
    This is the traditional authentication scheme where a user is presented with a login form and is asked to enter a username and a password in order to identify themselves.

    Upon successful login, a session cookie is returned. Any subequent HTTP request can include the cookie in its request headers and the user will be  automatically identified 
    through the associated server-side session.
    
    The username/password pair should be passed by a POST request to the /account/login endpoint.
    
    This authentication method is mostly targeted to the DataTiger frontend components. If a customer implements their own authentication, the API key authentication 
    is more adequate.
    
    
    Here is an simple authentication example with curl:
    ```
      curl -X POST \
      https://preprod.api.datatiger.com/account/login \
        -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
        -d 'username=username_placeholder&password=password_placeholder'\
        -c cookieFile
    ```

    After the session has been authenticated (session identifier is stored in the cookieFile), it can be used for further requests (e.g. retrieve the list of available
    applications):
    ```
      curl -X GET \
      https://preprod.api.datatiger.com/applications \
      -b cookieFile
    ```
    
    ## Workflows
    The active workflows of an application collectively define how the DataTiger platform reacts to incoming user events.  Each workflow belongs to a single application and has
    a unique name within that application.
    
    ### Workflow activation
    Workflow activation is controlled by it's status and the trigger expressions. For a workflow to be activated from a user event the following conditions must be true:
    * The workflow must not be already in progress for that user 
    * The workflow status must be 'ACTIVE'
    * The trigger expression must evaluate to true
    
    When a workflow is activated, its steps are executed starting from the workflow starting step. The processing continues until the workflow reaches a final state or fails. Depending
    on the workflow, its execution may require waiting until some action if performed. 
    
    ### Trigger expressions
    Trigger expressions are boolean expressions over the user and event attributes (available attributes and operations are returned by the /datatypes request).
    Within a trigger expression, an event attribute is referenced using the 'event' prefix and a user attribute with the 'user' prefix.
    
    The expressions consist of the following:
    * AND, OR and NOT operators
    * parentheses
    * user and event properties such as 'user.UserId' or 'event.EventType'
    * Operators: One of ==, >, <, >=, <= 
    * Literals
      * Strings: 'strings are enclosed in single quotes'
      * DateTime: '2011-12-03T10:15:30'. The dateTimes are always expressed in UTC
      * Boolean: true / false
      * Integer: 1234, -1234
      * Float: 1.01
    * Expressions relative to now
      * user.LastActiveOn in the last 4 MINUTES
      
      
    A simple example expression is as follows:
    ```
      user.LastActiveOn in the last 1 DAYS AND event.eventType == 'UserUpdated'
    ```
    
    
    ### Workflow steps
    The workflow steps define what happens after a workflow is activated as a graph of nodes. All nodes share a set of common attributes:
    * name - gives a user friendly name to a node
    * description - useful for putting a note about the role of a specific node in the scenario
    * type - indicates the type of the node
    * transitions - From each node there's one or more labeled transitions to other nodes within the same scenario definition. This captures this
      information, like a list of pairs of the form (label, node names) 

    The node type must always be defined, and can be one of the following:
    * START - Start nodes are a special type of nodes that indicate the starting point of a workflow. There's only one START node per workflow definition and it has the special and reserved name 'START'.
    * TERMINAL - This node type indicates that the workflow ends at this point, they act like terminal points in the graph stopping any further traversing of the graph of nodes. There can be many TERMINAL 
      nodes per workflow definition and they can have custom names.
    * ACTION - This node type represents a webhook action, i.e. that a URL should be invoked as a result of the workflow reaching this step.
    * WAIT - Represents an unconditional wait action for a specified amount of time.
    * CONDITION - A condition node acts as a decision point to determine which path the workflow will follow out of multiple alternatives. 
    * WAIT_ON_CONDITION - A condition that is evaluated multiple times within a given time limit. If at any time the condition becomes true, 
      then the flow continues along the TRUE transition. Otherwise, if the time limit is passed and the condition is still false, then the FALSE transition is taken.
    * SENDGRID_EMAIL_ACTION - Action for sending an email through SendGrid.
     Distinct node types require specific properties to define their actions. All these are defined in the workflow types below.
     
     
    Each type of node has a set of predefined outgoing transitions as follows:
      
    * START
      * OK - The 'OK' transition will be followed unconditionally when encountering a START step. 
    * TERMINAL: No outgoing transitions are considered when reaching a TERMINAL. Instead the workflow is marked as completed at that point.
    * ACTION 
      * OK - Followed when the webhook call has been completed successfully
      * ERROR - Followed in case the call couldn't be made or we received a 5xx response code
    * WAIT
      * TIMEOUT - Followed when the requested delay has been reached.
    * CONDITION 
      * TRUE - Followed when the condition evaluates to TRUE
      * FALSE - Followed when the condition evaluates to FALSE
      * TIMEOUT - For conditions with a timeout setting, this will be followed when the requested delay has been reached.
